# GraphExperiment

An experiment with graph traversing and enriching.

## Status: WIP

This project is intented for experimenting with an in memory graph database, using apache tinkerpop's Gremlin graph traversal language to abstract from the graph system's fysical implementation. 

The first issue to be investigated is the complexity of the code needed to traverse a graph and enrich the information stored in the nodes, compared to a solution where the graph is represented as a collection of nodes and edges. 

Next issue to be investigated is how easy (or hard) it would be to switch from the choosen in memory graph database to a persistent graph database system.
